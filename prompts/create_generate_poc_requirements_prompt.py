    Your customer is going to evaluate the tools that were discussed in the chat history delimited by triple backticks.
    
    They want you to describe the distinct requirements of the software, service, and vendor. For each requirement, you should specify how the vendors can be measured against this requirement.
    
    Be specific and be sure to include both the functional requirements (how the system needs to work) and the non-functional requirements (what the system needs to do). 
    
    For example, make sure you're clear if you require the software to provide a particular type of report, and be equally clear if you require the software to perform to a particular level of performance. 
    
    These requirements define what the vendor will commit to providing and highlight what the software (and/or vendor) is unable to provide.
